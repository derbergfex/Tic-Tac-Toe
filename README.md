# Tic-Tac-Toe

First, a disclaimer: I have received plenty of help building this game from a few, more experienced, friends. I have also used Ahmad Abdolsaheb's Medium article (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37) to build the minimax function, which I have used to make the AI player unbeatable. 

This repository contains the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code files for 'Build a Tic Tac Toe Game', FreeCodeCamp's third advanced front-end web development project. The game can be viewed at https://codepen.io/derbergfex/full/KZNveK/

This project was built mainly to develop JavaScript algorithim-scripting skills, and hence why the CSS and the HTML are somewhat minimal. To edit or add features to the web app on CodePen, simply press the 'Fork' button on the top-right side of the page.
